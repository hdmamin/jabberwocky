-gpt3 writes a poem/interesting phrase, then GAN "illustrates" (image and or gif)
    -maybe some way to incorporate torch lucent for more interesting styles
    -incorporate clip to select best "painting"
    -available on github: dall-e, lucidrains dall-e/deep daze/big sleep (note: apparently openai dall-e text encoder is not open sourced so can't directly input text)
-gpt3 provides instructions for building something with stylebreeder (need to experiment a bit manually first)
-provide written (or spoken, followed by speech to text lib) bullet points, then expand to a full speech of some kind in your own voice. Think virtual assistant.
    -chatbot with yourself (prompt gpt3 with your own writing, then use voice cloning app for text to speech)
    -chatbot with famous person (others have done this with gpt3 so should be good pre-existing prompts) combined with voice cloner, so you can actually "chat" with (e.g.) jk rowling in real time. Not sure what audio requirements are for voice cloner yet.
    -transcribe audio (of a meeting, phone call, speech, etc.), generate written feedback, maybe deliver via audio
-ask how to do something, gpt3 provides step by step instructions in text (then text to speech app for a virtual assistant)
-something with GANs for video? Look through coursera notebook.
    -or gans for music? gpt-scrolls pypi lib has example of this, not sure how well it works but I imagine we could find a lib to convert those notes to audio. (Compose background music for gan-generated gif?)
-youtube assistant (chrome extension?)
    -specify a time chunk of a video and have gpt3 explain it in simpler terms (i.e. explain a difficult concept in a stats lecture to a 5th grader, 9th grader, etc.)
        -could even try to generate audio using the voice of the person in the video, though this might not work that well (not much available data, some have multiple speakers)
    -identify emotion/tone throughout the video (see spikes of anger, humor, sadness)
    -identify key points/takeaways
    -generate questions corresponding to various timestamps
    -not just youtube videos: live lectures from remote learning!
-translate my rambling questions/explanations into more concise points (a Harrison translator!)

-------
-idea: we can show gpt3 some paired examples of generated and manual transcripts in hopes it can "translate" from generated to manual. That way, we can get improved transcript quality for videos that only have generated transcripts.
