X -update cookiecutter template makefile and notes files
X -choose project name
X -final investigation of dearpygui vs kivy (+kivymd)
    [dearpygui mobile won't be ready in time. Use this if you want to build a desktop app, use kivy if you want to build mobile. Leaning mobile - dearpygui looks cool but I feel if I'm going to do something non-streamlit/dash, I should make it REALLY different. I'm now thinking the gans could be a problem though - gpt3 is just an api so that's fine, but I'd need to host the gans somewhere. This is meant to be pretty open ended though so I could do gan stuff on paperspace and then a voice app or something else for mobile (spoken/written bullet points -> speech in my voice?). Time may be a constraint though if I try to do both - gpt3 trial expires at end of June. Maybe learning fund can help out there.]
X -make new git project
X -write project requirements
X -write premortem
-write lessons from last time

-------
-write lessons from last time
-try out openai pypi package to make sure I can communicate w/ gpt3 programmatically
    -if necessary, write my own helper functions to wrap common actions
-look into how to use various gan packages (install? clone?)
-make sure I can still access paperspace
    -maybe update dotfiles/envs etc. on machine if necessary
