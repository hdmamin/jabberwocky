Start date: 4/9/21
Soft end date: 7/1/21 (12 weeks; gpt3 trial ends 5pm the night before)

Final Product
-------------
Required:
- >=1 mobile app OR desktop app (streamlit/dash/flask etc. does NOT satisfy this)
- >=1 illustrated poem/phrase where both the text and image are generated with at least some ML help

Optional:
- 1 web app
- mobile AND desktop app (1 or the other is required; both would be cool though since dearpygui looks intriguing)
- train >= 1 model (probably not really necessary for what I initially have in mind, but I feel I should keep my torch skills sharp so it might be a good idea to try to shoehorn something in)
    - pytorch lightning usage (easier to just keep using incendio, but realistically I probably should transition at some point)
    - try 1 new variant in gan training (coursera courses introduced a bunch of interesting things people have tried - progressive resizing, various forms of noise injection, mapping networks, etc. Should have enough intuition at this point that I could try out a variant in some of the pre-existing gan code out there. And if it doesn't work, the existing code is good enough that I should still be able to get fun results.)

Concepts
--------
-GANs - after those 2 coursera courses, it's time for some more applied work
-prompt engineering - I'm still not convinced this will be useful for long, but get some practice writing natural language prompts for GPT3.
-mobile and/or desktop gui development (been wanting to try this for a while, and I finally found a couple options that look satisfiably pretty)

Tech
----
-kivy and/or dearpygui
-nice to have but almost certainly unnecessary: multi GPU training. Just feel this would be good to learn at some point but this most likely isn't the project.

What could go wrong?
--------------------
1. Burnout (sensing a theme with these premortems.) Especially if model training gets involved.
[SOLUTION]
-put coursera gans courses on hold unless there's some content you specifically think could help with the current project.
-official expectation is 30 minutes, not 60.
-rule: if you catch yourself trying to watching the clock trying to stretch out a task to go from 27 minutes to 30, just wrap up. Coming in a couple minutes short is fine.
-keep edu reading requirements low. Just while brushing teeth is fine unless you want to read more.
-maybe try to get back into habit of keeping sessions relatively early (mornings on weekends, right after dinner on weekdays? Tradeoffs here but putting it off must be kind of mentally taxing).
-I didn't really use this last time, but keep flex day as an option. I just hate to have a zero progress day. Maybe try to maintain a few small cognitively lazy tasks at all times (e.g. writing a docstring) so I can choose a light day if necessary.

2. run out of gpt3 quota/time
[SOLUTION]
-This is a perfectly acceptable use of learning funds. Don't hesitate to buy more queries.

3. Frustration at custom GAN experiments not working
[SOLUTION]
-Set expectations low. Most experiments will go nowhere and that's normal.
-Start with pre-existing GAN code and make sure the default version works. Starting from scratch like with img_wang has so many opportunities for bugs to seep in.
    -Also, even if my variants don't work, we should have something cool. With img_wang, when stuff didn't work I just ended up endlessly debugging trivially simple tasks, which wasn't very inspiring.
-Remember the focus of this project - delivering something fun and maybe useful. The experimental aspect is very much secondary.

4. Generated art/audio etc. is disappointly low quality
[SOLUTION]
-If it happens, it happens. Gpt3 alone is pretty cool so surely we'll get some interesting stuff out of this.

5. Sidetracked working on gan experiments and don't get to do much gpt3 stuff before trial expires.
[SOLUTION]
-For one, I doubt this will happen, and if it does I can always buy more queries.

6. Project is challenging enough that it drags on a long time and I get bored/worn down by it
[SOLUTION]
-There are a few things I'd like to try and doing all of them thoroughly could take ages. Don't be afraid to postpone 1 or more of these til later. The models will only keep getting better the longer you wait.
-Introduce a mid-way checkin (not sure of name yet, but it makes sense: we have a premortem at the start, a postmortem at the end, now we add something in the middle.) Let's schedule something now for 8 weeks out so I don't forget. This is a time to take stock - am I enjoying the project, am I learning the things I thought I would, are things going wrong that I did or didn't foresee? Should I wrap up early?
