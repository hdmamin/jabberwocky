    Parameters
    ----------
    df: pd.DataFrame
        Results of youtube_transcript_api cast to a df.
    start: int
        Start time in seconds.
    end: int
        End time in seconds. The duration will therefore be (at least)
        (end - start) seconds.

    Returns
    -------
    str: Text transcript of the speech during the specified time segment. May
    include some text from before/after the specified segment because text is
    given in chunks of a few seconds (i.e. if we ask for time=3s to time=10s,
    we might end up with time=2s to time=13s because we don't have more
    fine-grained information).
