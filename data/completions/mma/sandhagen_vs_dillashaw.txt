Analysis: Cory Sandhagen has the talent and physical tools to be extremely dangerous offensively, but his actual fights always seem to be a bit closer than they should be. He has a tendency to get caught in exchanges and his defensive grappling is a bit iffy. Dillashaw is always dangerous because of his ability to get the finish at any moment. Sandhagen is a bit more technical, but he doesn't have the sort of defense that allows him to hang with Dillashaw's transitions.
