Analysis: McGregor's takedown defense has been steadily improving, and he has the speed and movement to strike with Poirier and avoid exchanges he can't win. Poirier doesn't have the best boxing, but he can crack with power and has a solid wrestling base. He can also scramble up quickly from the bottom, but getting there is a risky proposition against McGregor. McGregor's pressure and pace can create opportunities to land big strikes that time well, and his physical gifts are tough to match. He can finish whenever he wants and Poirier is still an underrated wrestler, but I think McGregor gets off more strikes and forces more action.
Prediction: Conor McGregor by KO.
