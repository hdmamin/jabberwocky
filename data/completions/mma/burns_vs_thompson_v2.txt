Analysis: This is a classic matchup of a striker looking to keep the fight standing and a grappler trying to bring it to the ground. Burns has perhaps the best boxing of anyone in the division and a solid counter game. He's a good pressure fighter and has a good understanding of movement to avoid takedowns, but he's not a great wrestler and he's very hittable. Thompson's wrestling and striking are both top-notch, and he's a crafty grappler with a big submission game and great cardio. Burns has never been submitted and has never been out of the first round, but Thompson has looked better and better each time out, and a win here would be a huge statement.
Prediction: Stephen Thompson by decision
