Analysis: Hardy's inability to defend strikes is a major issue against Tuivasa, who will be all over him and willing to swing for the fences. Hardy has power in his hands, but he's not a power puncher and he's often willing to swing at air with big looping shots. That's not an issue against most opponents, but against a guy like Tuivasa who he'll have to fight in the pocket, it can get him in trouble.
Prediction: Tai Tuivasa by TKO.
