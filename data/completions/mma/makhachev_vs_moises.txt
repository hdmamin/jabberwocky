Analysis: Islam Makhachev is a very well-rounded fighter, but he's also a bit one-dimensional. He's a grinding wrestler who can grind opponents down with his top control or stand up and work his grappling off his back. Thiago Moises can really defend himself off his back, and if Makhachev doesn't play it safe with his takedowns, he could find himself on his back a lot.
Prediction: Thiago Moises by submission
