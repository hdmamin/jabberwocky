Jon Jones vs. Francis Ngannou This is a fight that could be a complete bloodbath. Both men are very aggressive and have serious power. Ngannou will likely try to shoot quickly for a takedown, but there's a good chance Jones stuffs him. If Jones can keep the fight standing, there's a good chance he puts Ngannou out. His range is too much for Ngannou and he's got a lot of ways to get inside and hurt Ngannou. Ngannou is a very awkward striker, and Jones is the most experienced striker in UFC history.
Prediction: Jon Jones by KO
