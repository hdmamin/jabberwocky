Analysis: It's been a long time since we've seen Thompson fight, and it's fair to wonder if he'll still have the same pop on his counters or ability to end a fight in the blink of an eye. He's a very safe fighter, however, and his kicks, volume and power give him a clear edge in this matchup. It's possible that Burns will be able to get in his face or put him in the clinch, but that's not Thompson's game. He'll pick Burns apart with his low kicks and eventually turn this into a kickboxing match.
Prediction: Stephen Thompson by TKO.
