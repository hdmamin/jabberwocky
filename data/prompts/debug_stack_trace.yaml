reminder: "Could try davinci text as well but codex is free for now. You may want to strip triple double-quotes from the end in case codex generates them (we don't include that as a stop phrase because codex might generate a docstring as part of a correct code snippet)."

  Only allowed 4 stop sequences so had to exclude LOCAL VARIABLES. Added LOC to logit bias to try to avoid getting in that loop. Other logit bias is the docstring triple quote.

  """ANSWER KEY

  This code snippet throws an error. Help me fix it. First review the problematic code snippet and resulting stack trace, then examine the the local and global variables for additional clues. In the section titled SOLUTION PART 1, use plain English to explain what the problem is and how to fix it. In the section titled SOLUTION PART 2, write a corrected version of the input code snippet. If you don't know what the problem is, SOLUTION PART 1 should list a few possible causes or things I could try in order to identify the issue and SOLUTION PART 2 should say N/A. Be concise and use simple language because I am a beginning programmer.
