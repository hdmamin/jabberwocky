reminder: "Could try davinci text as well but codex is free for now. You may want to strip triple double-quotes from the end in case codex generates them (we don't include that as a stop phrase because codex might generate a docstring as part of a correct code snippet)."
doc: |-
  Debugging variant for jupyter nbextension duckling. Uses the selected cell's code as the current snippet and only provides global vars (unlike the original debugger prompt, we're not actively stepping through a function's execution). Don't use docstring quotes as stop words because codex likes to put natural language explanations inside them (i.e. there's a high risk that you will get no output). TODO might need to remove docstring stop sequence in case the generated solution should contain that.
prompt: |-
  This is a code snippet from my jupyter notebook that is not working as expected. Help me debug it. First read my question, then examine the snippet of code that is causing the issue and look at the values of the global variables in the notebook. Finally, explain what the problem is and instruct me on how to fix it. If you don't know what the problem is, list a few possible causes or things I could try in order to identify the issue. Use simple language because I am a beginning programmer.
