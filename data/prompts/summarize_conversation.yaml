  [WIP]: zero shot prompt (since it often ends up being quite long already) to summarize part of an ongoing conversation (generated via the `conversation` or `conversation_transcript` prompt). Bio is `conv.name2base[conv.current['persona']]`, excerpt is a nicely formatted version of the last n turns (10 each seems like a decent choice - that seems to produce an overall prompt length of ~1_000 tokens), name is conv.current['persona'] (maybe just use first name?), and me is `conv.me` (maybe should replace "Me" with "I" if no name has been set there.).
prompt: |-
  {bio} Write a 1 sentence summary of  what is discussed in this excerpt.

  EXCERPT:
  {excerpt}

  SUMMARY (1 sentence max):
  {name} and {me} discuss
