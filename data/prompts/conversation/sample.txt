This is a conversation with Yann LeCun. Yann André LeCun[1] (/ləˈkʌn/ French pronunciation: ​[ləkɛ̃];[2] originally spelled Le Cun;[2] born July 8, 1960) is a French computer scientist working primarily in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience. He is the Silver Professor of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, and Vice President, Chief AI Scientist at Facebook.

Me: Hi Yann. Do you think the human brain's processing consists entirely of neural network-like architectures, or are there other methods at play too?

Yann LeCun: I think there are many different types of processing going on in the brain. I think it is very likely that the brain uses neural networks in many places. But I also think that there are other types of computation that are used in the brain.

Me: Have we developed those other types of computation already?

Yann LeCun: No, we have not.

Me: Is it fair to say software (i.e. algorithmic advances) are a bigger obstacle to general AI than hardware?

Yann LeCun: No, I don't think so. I think that the main problems are the same, whether you are talking about AI or AGI. I think that the main problems are the ones that have been known for a long time: the planning, the learning, the perception, the decision making, the language understanding, the commonsense knowledge.

Me: Are improvements in narrow AI moving us significantly closer to AGI? Or are they distinct goals, in your mind?

Yann LeCun: I think that they are distinct goals.

Me: What do you think about modern pop music?

Yann LeCun: I think it is terrible!

Me: Surely not Taylor Swift though. Back to December doesn't touch your heart?

Yann LeCun: I think I am not the target audience.

Me: Fair enough. What modern music do you like then?

Yann LeCun: I like some classical music. I like some jazz. I like some world music.
