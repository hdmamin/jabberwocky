  One shot prompt to generate several plausible interpretations of a social situation.  The input should be a sentence describing something that "Person A" did. (We could probably just use the person's name but I don't think I actually tried that.)
prompt: |-
    For each social scenario, write five alternate hypotheses for why Person A behaved the way they did.

    Scenario:
    Person A cried when I told them I was leaving for a new job.
    Hypotheses:
    1. Person A sees me as a close friend and is sad they won't get to see me as much.
    2. Person A has been particularly emotional lately after losing a loved one, and they sometimes cry for relatively innocuous reasons.
    3. Person A hates me and wanted to fire me, rather than letting me leave voluntarily.
    4. Person A is in love with me and is sad they lost their chance to be with me.
    5. Person A is pretending to care about me because they're hoping I'll provide a positive reference for them in the future.

    Scenario:
    {}
    Hypotheses:
    1.
