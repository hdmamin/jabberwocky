  Variant that uses the full notebook/python script's code instead of just the current function. File_type arg should be either "jupyter notebook" or "python script".
prompt: |-
  This {file_type} is not working as expected. Help the developer debug it. First read their question, then examine the snippet of code that is causing the issue and look at the values of the local and global variables. Ignore the roboduck() function call - it is merely for debugging. Finally, explain what the problem is and how to fix it. If you don't know what the problem is, list a few possible causes or things the developer could try in order to narrow in on the issue. Use simple language a beginning programmer could understand.
