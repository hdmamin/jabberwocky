  Experimental few shot prompt to convert written numbers to numerals. The original motive was to help parse Alexa slots but IIRC the issue disappeared when I restricted the valid values for the slot - previously it accepted both numeric words and non-numeric words, so I think that made alexa resolve everything to non-numeric. Now that all valid "model" values are numeric, it provides numerals for us.
