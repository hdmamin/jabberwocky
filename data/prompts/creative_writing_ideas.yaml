  At query time, we sample n examples from a cache of some sort and pass them in as the `examples` arg (this should be a numbered list where the last line contains only a number and period). This is intended to get more variety in the generated prompts. Note that n must be >= the number of examples you select otherwise gpt won't generate any new list items.
