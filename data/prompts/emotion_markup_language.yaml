  Experimental one shot prompt to reformat text (intended to be conversational) to contain tags from a made up "Emotion Markup Language". Technically EML does exist though its syntax is different than what I specify here. This is a work in progress and should probably eventually change to use something more like <emotion type='sadness'> instead of <sadness> - seems like it might be desirable to make the output parsable as XML. Also consider what length inputs should be (1 sentence? 1 paragraph? Vary lengths dramatically?). Also consider if logit bias can/should be used to constrain to a subset of tags.
prompt: |-
  Edit the input passage so that it uses the appropriate Emotion Markup Language tags.
