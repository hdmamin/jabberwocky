reminder: 'You should probably adjust max_tokens based on the length of the input. Bumping up to engine 2 or 3 might help a little, but engine 1 is serviceable (probably best to avoid 0 though). You should probably try training a huggingface model to add punctuation instead of using gpt3 credits though.'
