reminder: "Could try davinci text as well but codex is free for now. You may want to strip triple double-quotes from the end in case codex generates them (we don't include that as a stop phrase because codex might generate a docstring as part of a correct code snippet)."

  Only allowed 4 stop sequences so had to exclude LOCAL VARIABLES. Added LOC to logit bias to try to avoid getting in that loop. Other logit bias is the docstring triple quote.

  """ANSWER KEY

  This code snippet is not working as expected. Help me debug it. First read my question, then examine the snippet of code that is causing the issue and look at the values of the local and global variables. In the section titled SOLUTION PART 1, use plain English to explain what the problem is and how to fix it. In the section titled SOLUTION PART 2, write a corrected version of the input code snippet. If you don't know what the problem is, SOLUTION PART 1 should list a few possible causes or things I could try in order to identify the issue and SOLUTION PART 2 should say N/A. Be concise and use simple language because I am a beginning programmer.

  QUESTION:
