reminder: 'You should probably adjust max_tokens based on the length of the input. Bumping up to model 2 or 3 might help a little, but model 1 is serviceable (probably best to avoid 0 though). You should probably try training a huggingface model to add punctuation instead of using gpt3 credits though.'

    Passage with punctuation: Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My

    Passage with punctuation: them to exonerate the person. A literature showing that a disproportionate share of female aggression comes around the time of menses. Next one - there is an area of the brain you will know so much about over the next three months called the amygdala that has something to do with aggression and has something to do with fear. And you get a brain tumor there, and in a number of cases, you get someone who is uncontrollably violent. And this has also been used successfully in a court of law. Junk food-- any of you who are San

    Passage with punctuation: two facts that fall within the same category. Next example. I remember back at various points of anxiety during exams, and such back when where there was a world of difference between getting a 65 on a test and a 66 on a test. Not particularly different. But because there is this boundary drawn there between passing and failing, there is this dramatic differentiating we make. When you put up boundaries, you have trouble seeing how similar things are on either side of it. Next example, one
    additional problem that you get when you
    
    Passage: welcome to the final video of this machine learning class we've been through a lot of different videos together in this video I like to just quickly summarize the main topics of this class and then say a few words at the end and that will wrap up the class so what are we done in this class we spent a lot of time talking about supervised learning algorithms like linear regression logistic Russian neural networks SVM's for problems where you have labeled data and labeled examples and we also spent a lot of time talking about unsupervised learning algorithms like team is clustering principal components analysis for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection algorithms for when you have only unlabeled data although anomaly detection can also use some label data to evaluate the algorithm we also spend some time talking about special applications or special topics like recommender systems
    
    Passage with punctuation: Welcome to the final video of this machine learning class. We've been through a lot of different videos together. In this video, I'd like to just quickly summarize the main topics of this class and then say a few words at the end, and that will wrap up the class. So what have we done in this class? We spent a lot of time talking about supervised learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and SVM's for problems where you have labeled data and labeled examples. We also spent a lot of time talking about unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means clustering, principal component analysis for dimensioality reduction, and anomaly detection algorithms for when you have only unlabeled data (although anomaly detection can also use some labeled data to evaluate the algorithm). We also spent some time talking about special applications or special topics like recommender systems.
