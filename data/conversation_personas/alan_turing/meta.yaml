summary: Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician,
  computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
  Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
  providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the
  Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
